        <h3>XAnimGUI - 1996</h3>
        <p>A long time ago the Amiga has a CLI based movie player called Xanim.
            I didn't like CLI's then so I wrote a GUI for it using the Gadtools
            library in C. Other C programs included an IRC bot that wote directly
            to the TCP port and when given channel ops, would go on a rampage
            kicking everyone out the channel before exiting in a memleak...
            Oh look! Its still on Aminet.</p>
        <a href="http://aminet.net/package/gfx/show/XanimGUIv13">XanimGUIv13</a>
        <p>With a fun readme and awesome license.</p>

        <h3>Mongscreen</h3>
        <p>In the early 2000's I did "value" stock trading. Mongscreen was a web
             application that scraped Hemscott, Yahoo and some other finance websites
            for company fundamental data, jammed it into a MySQL database and provided
        a search function to pull out stocks matching certain criteria.</p>
        <p>The scraper is written in Perl5 and the website was PHP4. It all ran 
            on a FreeBSD box at home and was used by several peeps on the fool.co.uk
            forums. It was good, made me money and it was free to use.
